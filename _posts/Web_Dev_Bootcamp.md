# Web Development

I was part of a recent bootcamp, which I hope I graduate from, It was for web development which i was
not really familiar with.

All i knew before the bootcamp were the basics of HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and my staples of Java and Python. 
My eyes were then opened to new technologies which are widely used in the web development space. NodeJS is 
very powerful and used in a lot of popular websites.

With all the popular plugins and frameworks you can achieve so much with NodeJS and it was really eye-opening 
experience, hopefully I will be able to apply my newly acquired skills in the future.

The program helped create a simple but powerful signin, login and profile editing application used on most modern websites.

Its been a very interesting and fulfilling journey on this platform (Zaio).
